The Mobile Data Disbursement API enables secure provisioning of mobile data bundles to one or multiple recipients.
This endpoint supports both bulk distribution scenarios and individualized allocations while maintaining the same
authentication and access control used across all Belio API services.

Optionally, you can include SMS notifications to recipients after their data bundle has been successfully disbursed.

## Prerequisites

Before using this endpoint, ensure you have:

- An active campaign for mobile data disbursement — available from the [Campaigns](https://cloud.belio.co.ke/mobile-data/campaigns)
page.
- There are two ways to get a Campaign ID:
- Go to the [Campaigns](https://cloud.belio.co.ke/mobile-data/campaigns) page and copy the ID by clicking the copy icon on the
table as shown on the photo below.

- Call the [List Campaigns](/campaign/list) endpoint to retrieve all available campaigns and their IDs.

- API client authorization — Ensure your API Client includes permission to perform mobile data disbursement via `reward.mobile-data.disbursement`
authorization scope. These can be managed from the [API Clients](https://cloud.belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys) page.

## Optional SMS Notifications

Messaging is optional. If `messaging` is omitted, the request disburses data only (no SMS).

If messaging is used, SMS is sent after successful data disbursement and consumes SMS units independently of data units.

### Messaging Configuration

When `messaging` is provided, `messaging.serviceSelection` is required.

- `DefaultService` — uses an auto-configured/default Belio's SMS service
- `SelfService` — uses an explicitly provided SMS service ID (`serviceId`). View available services via [List Services](/service/list)
or [Message Introduction](/message/introduction) .


### SendToMany

Use `SendToMany` to send the same `denomination` to multiple `phones`. You may include a single `messaging.message` (max **960** characters) to notify all recipients.

```json
{
  "type": "SendToMany",
  "phones": ["+254712345678", "+254701234567"],
  "denomination": "1GB"
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "SendToMany",
  "phones": ["+254712345678", "+254701234567"],
  "denomination": "1GB",
  "messaging": {
    "message": "Your 1GB bundle has been credited.",
    "serviceSelection": { "type": "DefaultService" }
  }
}
```

### SendToEach

Use `SendToEach` to send different `denomination` values per recipient. Each disbursement may include an optional `message`, and you can mix recipients with and without messages.

If **any** disbursement includes a `message`, the top-level `messaging` configuration becomes mandatory. If no disbursement includes a message, `messaging` is optional and can be omitted.

```json
{
  "type": "SendToEach",
  "messaging": {
    "serviceSelection": { "type": "SelfService", "serviceId": "svc_123" }
  },
  "disbursements": [
    { "phone": "+254712345678", "denomination": "2GB", "message": "You’ve received 2GB data." },
    { "phone": "+254701234567", "denomination": "500MB" }
  ]
}
```
- API client authorization — Ensure your API Client includes permission to perform SMS sending via `message.sms.send.oneway`
authorization scope. These can be managed from the [API Clients](https://cloud.belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys) page.

## Delivery Receipts

You can include an optional `receiptRequest` to receive delivery receipts for data disbursement and (when messaging is used) SMS delivery status. Receipts may be delivered asynchronously and out of order.

## Optional Delivery Tracking

You may include an optional `receiptRequest` object in the request body to receive webhook notifications when a disbursement
attempt completes. When messaging is enabled, receipts can also cover SMS delivery status. Receipts may be delivered
asynchronously and out of order.

The `receiptRequest` object includes:

- **correlator** — A unique client-defined identifier used to correlate the delivery receipt with the original request.
- **callbackUrl** — A publicly accessible URL where delivery receipts will be pushed.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.belio.co.ke/data/{campaignId} \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    ...
    "receiptRequest": {
      "correlator": "<unique-id>",
      "callbackUrl": "https://example.org/webhook"
    }
  }'
```

By using the Mobile Data Disbursement API, you can automate bandwidth provisioning workflows, enable bulk allocations, and maintain
traceability through correlators and callback receipts—ensuring a reliable and auditable delivery process.
