title: Delivery Receipts
---

Delivery receipts provide a mechanism to track the final status of data bundle disbursement requests. When you submit a request with a `receiptRequest` object, the system will send a delivery receipt to your specified callback URL once the provisioning attempt reaches its final state.
This enables real-time monitoring of data disbursement success, failure, or pending conditions.

<Note>
  Delivery receipts are only sent when a `receiptRequest` object is included in the original data disbursement request.
</Note>

<Note>
  Ensure that the callback URL is publicly accessible and can accept incoming HTTP `POST` requests without requiring authentication.
</Note>

## Delivery Receipt Format

A delivery receipt is sent as an HTTP `POST` request to the specified callback URL containing the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "correlator": "8f24c8c6-7e7c-4b6f-a622-d4a25f91d3c1",
  "phone": "+254123456789",
  "denomination": "2GB",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:30:00Z",
  "status": "Delivered",
  "reason": "ok",
  "reasonCode": "200"
}
```

### Possible Delivery Status Values

| Status                | Description                                                                                   |

<Note>
    Callback endpoints must return **HTTP 200 OK** to acknowledge receipt. Failure to do so may trigger retry behavior
    depending on delivery policies.
