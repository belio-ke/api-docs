We use Bearer token authentication for securing access to the Belio REST API.
Use your `client_id` and `client_secret` to obtain a Bearer token for authentication.
Once you have your Bearer token, you can start making requests to our API endpoints.

<Note>
  To get the `client_id` and `client_secret`, you need to request for API access
  at [API Access Clients](https://belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys)
</Note>

## How to Authenticate

Authentication is simple - just include your Bearer token in the Authorization header when making API requests to our endpoints.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>
```

## Advanced Security

On the [API Access Clients](https://belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys) page, you can set up additional security measures:

- **Authorization Scopes**: Define specific scopes for your API keys, controlling access to different parts of the API. Available scopes include:

  - `mobilize.sms.send.oneway`: Send one way SMS
  - `mobilize.service.list`: List services

- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict API access to specific IP addresses, adding an extra layer of security for your production environment.
  Example: `192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.5, 203.0.113.42, 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334, fd00:1234:5678::1`

- **Web Origins**: Define allowed web origins (domains) that can make API requests, preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.
  Example: `https://yourdomain.com, https://app.yourcompany.io`

These security features help ensure that only trusted sources can access your API keys and make requests to the Belio REST API.
