Belio provides REST API endpoints for developers to integrate with our platform.
The API is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing you to interact
with your data in a way that suits your needs.

```http
https://api.belio.co.ke
```

This API follows HTTP rules, enabling a wide range of HTTP clients can be used to interact with the API.

## Getting Started

To get started, request for API access at [API Access Clients](https://cloud.belio.co.ke/team-overview/api-access-keys).
This will provide you with a `client_id` and `client_secret`.
Make sure to keep these credentials secure, as they are used to authenticate your requests.

<Note>
    Your `client_secret` is only shown once at generation. Store it securely. If
    lost, you can generate a new one from the API Access Keys page.
</Note>
