title: Delivery Receipts
---

Delivery receipts provide a mechanism to track the status of messages sent through the API. When you send a message with a `receiptRequest`, the system will send a delivery receipt to your specified callback URL once the message reaches its final state.
This allows you to monitor the delivery status of your messages in real-time.

<Note>
  Delivery receipts are sent to the callback URL specified in the
  `receiptRequest` object of the message request. If you do not include a
  `receiptRequest`, no delivery receipt will be sent.
</Note>

<Note>
  Ensure that the callback URL is publicly accessible and can handle incoming
  HTTP POST requests to receive the delivery receipts.
</Note>

## Delivery Receipt Format

A delivery receipt is sent as an HTTP POST request to your callback URL with the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "type": "DeliveryReceipt",
  "correlator": "8f24c8c6-7e7c-4b6f-a622-d4a25f91d3c1",
  "phone": "+254123456789",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-02T14:30:00Z",
  "deliveryStatus": "Delivered"
}
```
